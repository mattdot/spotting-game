# The Spotting Game: Official Rules
August 2023 Edition (DRAFT)


# 1. The Game

## 1.1 Fundamentals: 

The Spotting Game is an exciting and engaging activity designed to transform any car journey into a competitive adventure. It's a game of keen observation and swift decision-making, where any number of participants, either individually or in teams, spot specified vehicles during a ride. The game awards points to the first spotter, creating a lively atmosphere of alertness and precision. Open to all ages, this game makes every trip, mundane or otherwise, a thrilling venture.

## 1.2 Objective: 

The objective is to accumulate the highest score by correctly spotting as many specified vehicles as possible during the journey. 

## 1.3 Player Conduct: 

Players are expected to act with integrity, display consideration for others, and respect the spirit of the game. The foundation of the Spotting Game lies in fairness, honesty, and sportsmanlike behavior. Players are required to know and follow the rules of the Spotting Game. Any disputes are resolved by a the referee, with decisions guided by fairness and adherence to the game's rules.

# 2. Vehicles

## 2.1 Definition of a Vehicle:

A vehicle is any self-propelled transport mechanism, designed for land, water, or air use, with an intended capability for human operation. This includes, but is not limited to, cars, trucks, motorcycles, boats, aircraft, ATVs, snowmobiles, jet skis, construction vehicles, hovercrafts, and amphibious vehicles.  Trailers, carriages, miniatures, and models are excluded.

## 2.2. Classes of Vehicles: 

The Spotting Game recognizes the following classes of vehicles: delivery vehicles, buses, emergency vehicles, construction vehicles, and golf carts.

### 2.2.1 Delivery Vehicles: 

These include marked vehicles from recognized courier services, namely UPS, FedEx, DHL, USPS, and Amazon Prime. Unmarked delivery vehicles or those from other courier services are not counted.

### 2.2.2 Buses: 

This class includes larger vehicles commonly associated with mass public transportation or group travel, such as city transit buses, school buses, and full-sized charter buses, while excluding smaller vehicles often used for more localized or specific transport tasks, like minibuses, shuttle services, and vans, regardless of their labeling or intended usage.  Double-decker buses and articulated buses, also known as "bendy buses", are categorized as special vehicles.

### 2.2.3 Emergency Vehicles: 

This class includes a broad range of vehicles clearly branded as official emergency response units. They encompass police cars, motorcycles, and other police vehicles; ambulances, including paramedic response vehicles and medical helicopters; fire department vehicles, including ladder trucks, rescue vehicles, and fire chief cars; lifeguard vehicles, including trucks, ATVs, or watercraft; and security vehicles, including those used by mall security, private security, or community watch groups. Unmarked vehicles or private vehicles resembling these classes do not count. Military vehicles other than the Coast Guard are not considered emergency vehicles.

### 2.2.4 Construction Vehicles:

The construction vehicles class includes heavy-duty vehicles that are specifically designed for tasks related to earthwork operations, building construction, and other large-scale infrastructure projects. This excludes common road vehicles like pickup trucks or vans, even if they're branded with a construction company's logo. Examples of Construction Vehicles include but are not limited to excavators, bulldozers, backhoe loaders, skid-steer loaders (Bobcat), wheel loaders, dump trucks, concrete mixers, road rollers, trenchers, crawler loaders, tower cranes, mobile cranes, paver machines, graders, pile drivers, front shovels, scrapers (self-loading), articulated haulers, drilling machines, and compact track loaders. 

### 2.2.5 Golf Carts: 

The Golf Cart class is intended to include vehicles recognized as golf carts, irrespective of their location or operation status. Both traditional two-seater style and larger multi-seater golf carts are included. Golf carts also encompass utility carts as long as they resemble a standard golf cart. Personalized or custom golf carts are valid as long as they remain identifiable as golf carts. However, small utility vehicles that are not identifiably golf carts, such as airport luggage carts, do not fall within this class.

## 2.3 Types of Vehicles: 

Types of vehicles include regular vehicles and special vehicles.

### 2.3.1 Regular Vehicles: 

These are standard, single-unit vehicles within the aforementioned classes. Regular vehicles contribute **one point** to the player's score when spotted.

### 2.3.2 Special Vehicles: 

These encompass vehicles with unique features or increased utility within the classes. 
- **Double Vehicles (2 points)** include articulated buses, double-decker buses, and trucks with two trailers.
- **Boats (3 points)** such as Coast Guard and patrol boats.
- **Aircraft (4 points)** include helicopters and airplanes related to the classes of vehicles.
- **Golf carts (5 points)** include normal golf carts as well as carts within other classes like security golf carts.

### 2.3.3 Bonuses:

The official referee may institute a 'Local Rule' for a game that awards one extra bonus point for spotting vehicles of special significance. The definition of 'special significance' should be clearly outlined by the official referee before the start of the game and could be influenced by factors such as the locale, occasion, or specific vehicles of interest. All players must agree to the Local Rule for it to be applied.

For example, if the game is being played in Los Angeles, the referee might declare a Local Rule that awards a bonus point for spotting a bus branded with the University of Southern California. If all players agree to this Local Rule, spotting such a vehicle will award the spotter with an additional bonus point.

## 2.4. Official Referee's Discretion: 

Notwithstanding the aforementioned definitions, it's the sole discretion of the official referee to determine whether a spotted vehicle fits within a specific class or type of vehicle. The referee's decision is final.

# 3. Point System

## 3.1 Earning Points

### 3.1.1 Single Vehicles:

Players earn points by successfully spotting vehicles that meet the defined classes, types, and categories. Points are awarded as follows:

- Regular vehicles: 1 point each
- Special vehicles: points according to their specific type (2, 3, 4, or 5 points)
- Bonuses: 1 extra point may be awarded for vehicles of special significance under the 'Local Rule'

### 3.1.2 Homes:

In addition, players can identify a "home". A home is a group of three or more co-located vehicles of the same class, subclass, and type (e.g., three or more UPS delivery trucks). If a player identifies a home, they are awarded 3 times the points value of the identified class and type of vehicle, inclusive of the base and bonus points. A home can only be claimed once, and it must be distinctly separate from other homes (e.g., a UPS home is different from a FedEx home). There is no maximum number of vehicles for a home - even if it contains 100 vehicles, it still counts as 3x the points.

The "home" rule helps in preserving the competitive balance of the game. By capping the points a player can earn from spotting a collection of vehicles in a single location, it prevents the game from being disproportionately swayed by a single observation. This ensures that success in the game is more evenly distributed across a player's overall spotting skill and strategy, rather than being heavily influenced by one fortunate find.

## 3.2 Simultanious Spotting

In cases where two or more players claim to have spotted a vehicle simultaneously, no points are awarded for that spotting.

## 3.3 Incorrect Spotting

If a player incorrectly identifies a vehicle, they will lose points equivalent to their claim. This rule encourages precision and careful observation, discourages random guessing, and emphasizes the importance of accurate vehicle identification to uphold the integrity of the game.

# 4. Form of Play

## 4.1 Regular Game

In a regular game, players are restricted to spotting and correctly identifying vehicles from a specific class chosen at the start of the game. All players are trying to spot vehicles from this same class. 

## 4.2 Everything Game

In an "Everything Game", the objective remains the same, but players are free to spot and correctly identify vehicles from any of the defined classes. This increases the range of vehicles that can be spotted, thus making the game more challenging.

# 5. Playing the Game

## 5.1 Start of Play:

The game begins when all the players are situated in the car, signified by a declaration from the referee.

## 5.2 Determining the Form of Play

The form of play is determined by the first two vehicles spotted after the game starts.

If the first two vehicles spotted belong to the same class, the game proceeds as a Regular Game, with all players focusing on spotting and correctly identifying vehicles from this specific class.

On the other hand, if the first two vehicles spotted belong to different classes, the game becomes an Everything Game. In this case, players are allowed to spot and correctly identify vehicles from any of the defined classes.

## 5.3 Pausing a Game:

A game can be paused when requested by a player if agreed upon by the referee. During a pause, no vehicles may be spotted, and any attempts to do so will be disregarded. This ensures fairness, especially in situations where one or more players might be unable to continue spotting. The referee will declare when the game is paused and when it resumes.

## 5.4 Conclusion of Play:

The conclusion of play occurs when any player exits the car. At this point, the referee declares the game over and no further spotting can be made. The player with the most points at the conclusion of the game is declared the winner. Any disputes regarding the game's outcome should be settled by the referee, whose decision is final. In keeping with the spirit of the game, sportsmanship is expected, and the final decision should be accepted with grace.

## 5.5 Resumption of Play: 

A game from a previous leg of a journey can be resumed if all players agree. The agreement to continue occurs when everyone is back in the car, and rules and points from the prior game remain in effect. The referee declares the resumption of the game.

# 6. Teams

## 6.1 Formation of Teams:

At the start of the game, players may opt to form teams. Any number of players can form a team and the teams do not need to be balanced in terms of number of players. Players are not required to join a team and can compete as individuals against teams.

## 6.2 Scoring in Teams:

The points earned by team members are cumulative and contribute to the team's overall score. In the case of simultaneous spotting within the same team, the team is awarded the point. If an incorrect spotting is made by a team member, the penalty affects the entire team's score.

## 6.3 Team Play:

Team members are allowed to assist each other in spotting vehicles.

## 6.4 Team Modifications:

Teams can be modified or dissolved at the referee's discretion. Affected players may play individually or join other teams. Points originally scored remain with the initial team unless the referee determines a transfer to be fair and upholds the game's spirit.

## 6.5 Exclusive Team Membership:

A player cannot be a part of multiple teams at the same time. The points a player earns exclusively accrue to the team they are currently a part of.

# 7. Special Circumstances

## 7.1 Identification:

If a player is unable to accurately identify a vehicle's class or type but still wishes to claim it, they may do so by providing a general description of the vehicle. The referee will then make a decision based on the description. If the referee cannot confidently categorize the vehicle based on the description provided, the spot will be considered invalid.

## 7.2 Obstructed Views:

If the view of a vehicle is obstructed, but enough of the vehicle can be seen to reasonably deduce its class or type, then it may still be claimed. The referee has the final say in whether or not a vehicle was identifiable.

## 7.3 Preemptive Spotting:
Players are not permitted to claim a spot based on prior knowledge or expectation of a vehicle's location from previous games. Spotting a vehicle must always be based on direct observation during the current game. Any preemptive claims will be considered invalid.

## 7.4 Multiple Spottings of Same Vehicle:

In the event the same vehicle is spotted by a player multiple times during a game (for instance, if the vehicle is moving in the same direction and at a similar speed as the players), it may only be claimed once.

## 7.5 Parades and Convoys:

In the event of a parade or convoy of vehicles, each identifiable vehicle may be claimed separately if they belong to different classes or subclasses of vehicles. However, if they belong to the same class or subclass, the 'home' rule applies.

## 7.6 Non-operational Vehicles:

Vehicles do not have to be operational or in motion to be claimed. This includes but is not limited to decommissioned vehicles, vehicles being towed, and vehicles on display.

# 8. Role of the Referee

The referee ensures game integrity by fairly interpreting and applying rules, using past precedents for consistency. They balance rule enforcement with trust-building, fostering fair play and good sportsmanship. Their role enhances the game's quality and enjoyment, making each play competitive yet respectful.

## 8.1 Trust and Judgement:

Trust is the cornerstone of the referee's responsibilities. Recognizing the game's essence, which relies heavily on honesty and camaraderie among players, referees should lean towards trusting the players' declarations. The account of a player regarding an event or rule adherence should be taken as truth unless there's significant grounds to doubt its accuracy.

## 8.2 Evidence Standard:

In instances of disagreements or uncertainty, the referee's judgment should hinge on evidence 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' This stringent proof criterion safeguards players from unjust penalties or rulings based on mere doubt or conjecture. Evidence sufficient to meet this criterion should be clear, robust, and compelling enough to persuade a reasonable observer of a certain fact or occurrence. Anything short of this should not be grounds for disputing a player's claim.

## 8.3 Conflict Resolution:

A critical duty of the referee is to manage conflicts. They must remain unbiased and impartial while deciphering and implementing the rules of the spotting game. In situations where a player's interpretation of a rule clashes with the referee's, the referee has the obligation to articulate the rule and provide a thorough explanation for their ruling. This open dialogue can help sustain player trust, even in cases of unfavorable decisions.

## 8.4 Promotion of Fair Play:

Above all, the referee is the guarantor of fair play. They ensure equal application of rules, supervise player behavior, and manage the game environment. By doing this, they help maintain an equitable playing field and uphold the game's competitive equilibrium. Despite their enforcement role, referees should aim to be unobtrusive, allowing the players' skills and tactics to dictate the game's progression.

# 9. Adapting the Rules

## 9.1. Amendments:

The rules of the Spotting Game, while comprehensive, are not immutable. Recognizing the evolving nature of transportation and the necessity for adaptability, any player may propose amendments to these rules. The amendment proposal should be clearly communicated and accompanied by a thorough explanation of the rationale behind it.

If a rule amendment is accepted, it shall be documented and integrated into the existing rule set, ensuring clarity and accessibility for all current and future players. The implementation of a new rule should never disadvantage any player retroactively.

## 9.2 Provisional Rules:

Provisional rules are experimental rules that can be trialed in games for the purpose of enriching the gameplay or addressing unique circumstances.

Provisional Rules function as "Local Rules," which means they are implemented at the discretion of the referee for a specific game or series of games. These rules are temporary by nature, and their usage does not automatically imply incorporation into the official rule set.

Just like formal rules, Provisional Rules must be communicated clearly to all players before the start of the game, and their acceptance is subject to a majority agreement among the players.

These trial games with Provisional Rules serve as a testing ground, allowing players to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of potential rule changes. Should a Provisional Rule prove beneficial and enhance the game, it may be proposed for formal inclusion into the official rules via the standard rule amendment process.
